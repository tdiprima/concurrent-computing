## C and C++ Code Collection

This repository contains a collection of C, C++, and header (`.h`) files borrowed from various sources. Efforts have been made to include proper credit in the header comments of each file.

### Modifications
- I have added summary comments at the top of each file to provide an overview of its functionality. These changes were made to enhance clarity and usability.
- The code has been Dockerized to create a portable and consistent environment for compiling and running these files. The Docker setup and associated scripts are my original work.

### Acknowledgments
- If you recognize any code that is missing proper attribution, please let me know. This collection was originally assembled around 2011, and some credits may have been unintentionally omitted. I sincerely apologize for any oversight.

### Purpose
- This repository serves as a reference and resource for programming projects.
- Use the Dockerized environment to compile and run the code easily.
- Feel free to explore, use, or learn from the code, but please respect the original authors and contributors.
