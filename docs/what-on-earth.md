### Observations

It looks like if you're using cmake<br>
and you've built with an external dependency<br>
if you re-write a file that's using that dependency,<br>
you have to erase your build directory<br>
and do cmake again, and then make.<br>
Otherwise, you get weird cache-type things happening.

There could be errors, but you'd never know it if the function never gets called from anywhere.
