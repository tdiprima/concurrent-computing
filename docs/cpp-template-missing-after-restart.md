## Resolving the Disappearance of C++ Template in Visual Studio

[Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/295487/how-to-solve-missing-templates-in-visual-studio-en)

**Problem:**

I'm utilizing Visual Studio Community 2013. I didn't set a default project template during the setup phase. I initiated a project with the Visual C++ template. After exiting Visual Studio and reopening it, I attempted to start a new project. However, my Visual C++ template seems to have disappeared.

**Solution:**

```markdown
Terminate the new project creation process.
Press Ctrl+Shift+N to restart.
And there you have it - the template reappears!
```
