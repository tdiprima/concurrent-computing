## C++ template missing after restart

**QUESTION:**

I'm using Visual Studio Community 2013.  When I set it up, I didn't identify a default project template.  I created a project using the Visual C++ template.  Then I Exited VS.  I opened VS again, started to create a new project, and my Visual C++ template is missing.

**ANSWER:**

```
Cancel New Project creation
Do ctrl-shift-N again
Et voila - it's back.
```
