# This is a Makefile script used for managing the compilation of a project by defining a set of rules. It utilizes the PGCC compiler for compilation, 
# linking using the same compiler, and sets several flags, paths, and variables to be used in the build process. 
# OPTFLAGS variable sets optimization flags for the compiler
# LIBS variable is intended to specify any libraries that the project might be dependent on.
# CFLAGS variable adds the ability to directly pass options/params to the compiler
# OBJ and EXE are variables that are used to denote object and executable files respectively.
# RM is a variable used for the deletion of files.
# NOTE: This script doesn't define any targets, dependencies or build rules as it's merely setting up basic configuration parameters.
