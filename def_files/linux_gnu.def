# This is a makefile script for a C++ project that uses the g++ compiler on a Linux system.
# The script specifies the compiler, linker, flags, libraries, and other settings used in the build process.
# The "-fopenmp" option is for enabling OpenMP support, which allows for parallel programming.
# The "-lm" option links the math library.
# The project uses object (".o") files and executable files, and "rm" command is used for removing files.
